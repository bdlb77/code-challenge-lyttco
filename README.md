# Code Challenge

**Lytt**, the first digital assistant that makes it easy for employees to communicate sensitive topics at work and is currently working in a new assistant functionality: recognize a message language and reply with the correct Bot message. Lytt is asking you _to develop this new REST API!_


## 1. Guidelines

-   **Detect** German, English and Spanish language only
-   **Receive** a text message from a reporting person (user) in any language
-   **Reply** with the correct Salutation on every user input, in the correct user session

As this challenge is based on the concept of real-time conversations (chat bots), you are encouraged to use a front-end implementation to demonstrate the challenge (we are big fans of React).

In the file `/locales/dialogues.{language}.yml` you can get an insight of how to organize your assistant internationalization functionality.

You are free to explore different solutions and any framework, but you should document and justify your technology choices. **Please write a README explaining your decisions.**

## 2. Receive a user message

A user will join a Chat Session and can send any message into that session. User messages will always go through this process and messages should have an unique, randomly generated ID.

The session is used to keep track of how many messages were sent between a user and the bot and if a refresh occurs, still display past messages _from that session_.

**Request**

    POST "/sessions/{session-id}/messages"
```json5
{
    "text": "{user-text-input}",
    "identifier": "{unique-generated-id}"

}
```

**Response (success)**

```json5
// Supported language
{
  "message": {
    "identifier": "{unique-generated-id}",
    "detected_language": "es",
    "timestamp": "2020-08-01T18:20:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Response (error)**

```json5
// Language is not supported
{
 "error": {
   "code": 422,
   "message": "Unfortunately we don't have support for your language yet."
  }
}
```

_a) Response Status should be 201 for success_
_b) Response Status should be __422__ for error_




## 3. Fetch a message

This endpoint returns the information about a message sent into the session. It can be used to retrieve information about a previous message.

**Request**

```javascript
GET "/sessions/{session-id}/messages/{identifier-id}"
```

**Response (success)**

```json5
    {
    "message": {
        "identifier": "{identifier-id}",
        "detected_language": "es",
        "timestamp": "2020-08-01T18:20:00Z"
    }
}
```

**Response (error)**

```json5
// Message ID doesn't exist for this session
{
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Resource doesn't exist"
  }
}
```

_a) Response status should be 200 for success_
_b) Response status should be 404 for error_
_c) Content-Type should be JSON_




## 4. Reply with Bot Message

The first message sent into the session defines the language that is going to be used in the entirety of the conversation between the user and the bot.

This endpoint provides all replies from the bot in the detected language for this session. The replies should be ordered by timestamp in **descending** order.

_After the first message, you should not display the salutation again_.

**Request**

```javascript
GET "/sessions/{session-id}/replies"
```

**Response**

```json5
{
  "replies": [ // messages should be ordered from newest to oldest
    {
      "message": "Hallo! Ich bin ein virtueller Assistent und ich bin hier, um zu helfen. Was m√∂chtest du tun?",
      "shortname": "de.salutation",
      "reply_to": "{first-message-identifier}",
      "sent_at": "{timestamp}"
     },
     {
       "message": "In Zukunft werde ich in der Lage sein, jede deiner Fragen zu beantworten",
       "shortname": "de.after_salutation",
       "reply_to": "{second-message-identifier}",
       "sent_at": "{timestamp}"
     }
  ]
}
```

_**Hint:**_ You can find language detection libraries for almost any programming language online_

## 5. Optional Extras

We would love to see an implementation that contains one or more of the items below, but they are optional:

-   Project uses `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
-   Chat between user and bot uses `WebSockets`
-   Front-end can be used to send messages
-   Front-end test framework was used


## 6. What we are looking for

For this challenge, we are looking at how you document, test and develop features given the guidelines provided using clean code. We want to see if you are familiar with the concepts of APIs, REST and HTTP.


## 7. How to deliver this challenge

Please deliver the solution using a public repository URL on GitHub. Your repository should contain full instructions and documentation for us to run and test the project. You can clone and develop on top of this repository as well.

Hosting the solution on a cloud provider (https://heroku.com, AWS, https://now.sh) is a great plus!


## 8. How we are evaluating

**a. Code Quality**

Is the code clean and understandable? Is the codebase organized in any existing pattern?

**b. Testing**

Is the project properly tested and covering edge cases? If tests are missing, what's the reasoning behind it?

**c. Validation**

Is the API properly validated? Does it validate the data sent to the server?

**d. Technology**

Does the technology options make sense for this project?

**e. Documentation**

Is the project properly documented with instructions and justifications of the technological choices?



## Summary

This project was built using React in the frontend and Rails in the backend. I decided to decouple the two and so both the frontend and backend are two separate apps.

### Challenges

#### User Session

I found the greatest challenge was deciding how to divide the session between two different users on the app. Since authentication wasn't mentioned I decided to try and tackle this without having a user. After great deliberation, I chose to go the route of initializing a Session by clicking a button which instantiates a `Session.new` and store the session in local storage. I chose this since I'm not very versed in JWT tokens and sessions between Rails ans React, and while running out of time I decided to go the route of localStorage.

#### Bot Replies

It took me a while to wrap my head around how to design the replies. I think I overcomplicated this section quite a bit.



### Technology

As mentioned before, this was done in a decoupled Rails and React project. I am familiar with doing it with `rails new --webpack=react` as a monolithic project, and so I wanted to also learn and grow comfortable with doing it in a decoupled manner. I believe the technologies work well together as it allows for a more dynamic frontend with a secure backend API (although I struggled with this and sessions). managing state I found quite useful this time around, so I'm happy I built in React. I decided to write everything in Hooks as it is a good app to practice it wit, so that was quite fun to dive into hooks and learn their lifecycles :)


## 1.Getting Started

  Since this is a decoupled app, you will need to run 2 servers. One for Rails and one for React.

### Local

  **backend**

  1. To run the Rails server, you can jump into the
  `/backend` directory:

   ```bash
      cd code-challenge-lyttco/backend/
      rails server
    ```

  2. Bundle install to retrieve gems

   ```bash
    bundle install
  ```

  3. start the rails server in the console:

  ```bash
    rails server
  ```

  2. you can view some of the routes by copy/pasting into the browser
    Example: `localhost:3000/api/v1/sessions/:id/replies`


  **frontend**

  1. To run the React frontend, jump into the `/frontend` directory
    ```bash
    cd code-challenge-lyttco/frontend/
    ```


  2. yarn install to download all yarn dependencies

  ```bash
    yarn install
  ```

  3. start the frontend server

  ```bash
    yarn start
  ```

  4.  The port made available for the frontend is `7000`. To interact with the API and project, open up in the browser:

  `localhost:7000`


  5. You should See a `Join Chat` button.

## 2. How it Works


1. Click on the `Join Chat` button

2. Type in a message to send to the API (chatbot) in the Input given

 2a. If the message is not in **German, English, or Spanish**, the API will respond with an alert notifying you that the bot doesn't handle other languages.

 2b. If the message is correct, the bot should reply with a salutation and a confirmation of which languages it can speak.

3. With each Reply from the bot, a `unique identifier` number will be present just below the reply. This number is used to find the corresponding metadata of the user's message sent to the bot.

  3a. If The number is clicked, the message details should append into the panel on the right hand side.

  3b. The metadata for the message should have present:

  `Identifier Number, Detected language, and TimeStamp`

4. If you exit out of the browser and come back, the messages should still appear, and your session should be persisted.


## 3. Testing

Rspec was the testing framework used for Rails. Tests are located under `app/spec/`


1. To Run tests go to the `/backend` directory.

```bash
  cd code-challenge-lyttco/backend/
```

2. Run this command in the console:

```bash
  rspec spec
```
